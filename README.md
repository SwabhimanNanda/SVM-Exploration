# SVM Exploration Repository

## Overview
Welcome to the SVM Exploration Repository! This repository contains code and resources related to the exploration of Support Vector Machines (SVM) in the context of supervised machine learning.

## Contents
- **svm_analysis_script.py**: Python script containing code for SVM implementation.
- **data**: Folder containing datasets used for SVM analysis.
- **notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks capturing the step-by-step SVM exploration process.
- **images**: Folder for storing images or visualizations related to SVM.

## Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/SVM-Exploration.git
   ```

2. Explore the Python script `svm_analysis_script.py` for SVM implementation.

3. Check out the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks` folder for a detailed step-by-step exploration.

4. Access datasets in the `data` folder for testing and further analysis.

## Dependencies
Ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed by running:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
